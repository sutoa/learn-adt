# Learning Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. ADK is designed to make agent development feel more like software development, making it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures.

## Introduction

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a powerful framework that allows you to:
- Build autonomous AI agents that can understand and execute complex tasks
- Create multi-agent systems with specialized agents working together
- Integrate with various tools and external services
- Deploy agents across different environments (local, cloud, etc.)
- Evaluate and monitor agent performance

## Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install ADK
   pip install google-adk
   ```

2. Configure Google Cloud (if using Vertex AI):
   - Set up a Google Cloud project
   - Enable necessary APIs
   - Configure authentication
